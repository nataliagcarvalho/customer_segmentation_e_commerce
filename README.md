# Customer Segmentation in Ecommerce

***

This is a project from the Laboratoria & IBM Certification.

The idea of this project is to do a descriptive analysis to show to the Ecommerce's CEO how good (or not) the sales are going, to measure the retention and churn rates by cohort and to do a customer segmentation applying the RFM metodology considering also de Pareto's Principle in order to concentrate the efforts on the "right" customers.
